Music::Tag::MP3 version 0.28
============================

Music::Tag::MP3 is a plugin module for Music::Tag which gathers info
from MP3 id3v1 and id3v2 headers using MP3::Info and MP3::Tag.

Note:  As of version 0.28, Music-Tag is distributed as seperate packages.

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

   Muisc::Tag
   MP3::Tag
   MP3::Info

Do not install an older version of MP3::Tag. 

NOTE ON ID3v2.4 TAGS

There seems to be a bug with MP3::Tag::ID3v2 0.9709. To use ID3v2.4 tags,
download MP3::Tag from CPAN and apply the following patch:

   patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

To do this change directory to the MP3::Tag download directory and type

   patch -p1 < ../Music-Tag-MP3/patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

Then install as normal

   perl Makefile.PL
   make && make test
   make install

NOTE ON GAPLESS INFO

This is used for a yet-to-be-maybe-someday released ipod library.  It collects
the required gapless info.  There is a patch to MP3-Info that should be applied
ONLY if you are interested in experimenting with this.  

TEST FILES

Are based on the sample file for Audio::M4P.  For testing only.
