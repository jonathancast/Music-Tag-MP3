NAME
    Music::Tag::MP3 - Plugin module for Music::Tag to get information from
    id3 tags

DESCRIPTION
    Music::Tag::MP3 is used to read id3 tag information. It uses MP3::Tag to
    read id3v2 and id3 tags from mp3 files. As such, it's limitations are
    the same as MP3::Tag. It does not write id3v2.4 tags, causing it to have
    some trouble with unicode.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES
    This module requires these other modules and libraries:

       Muisc::Tag
       MP3::Tag
       MP3::Info

    Do not install an older version of MP3::Tag.

NOTE ON ID3v2.4 TAGS
    There seems to be a bug with MP3::Tag::ID3v2 0.9709. To use ID3v2.4
    tags, download MP3::Tag from CPAN and apply the following patch:

       patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

    To do this change directory to the MP3::Tag download directory and type

       patch -p1 < ../Music-Tag-MP3/patches/MP3-Tag-0.9709.ID3v2.4.patch

    Then install as normal

       perl Makefile.PL
       make && make test
       make install

NOTE ON GAPLESS INFO
    This is used for a yet-to-be-maybe-someday released ipod library. It
    collects the required gapless info. There is a patch to MP3-Info that
    should be applied ONLY if you are interested in experimenting with this.

TEST FILES
    Are based on the sample file for Audio::M4P. For testing only.
